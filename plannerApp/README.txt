Here it is. 

The code's kind of bloated, and there's almost no input validation on any of the forms. 

Calendar events that are scheduled for a date in the past will sometimes fire as if they're in the present. 
(I think I know how to fix this, but I'm out of time to do it.) 

A next step would be to make it possible to view the entire schedule at once. 

This webapp takes advantage of HTML5's Local Storage capability to save schedules on disk between sessions. 
(Try creating an event, closing the window, and then opening it again. The event is still there.)

It's functional on computers, iPads, and smartphones.

I haven't had time to create a template schedule, so you'll have to go through and create your own test events. 
(Click the cog menu.)

This app isn't perfect, but it works. Access it on any device from http://planner.shroomdoom.com/  

Thanks for the term. Have a great break!
